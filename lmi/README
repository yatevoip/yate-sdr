Requirements
------------

PHP, Apache, YateBTS are required to run the software.

Installing
----------
TBI: modify the installation part 

Depending on your operating system the main web directory will be /var/www (debian based systems) 
or /var/www/html otherwise. If you don't have this path, then you need to install Apache server.

Assuming you install YateBTS package or installed by hand(make install), the UI source code is 
located in /usr/local/share/yate/nib_web.

 > cd /var/www/html   (or cd /var/www on debian based OS)
 > ln -s /usr/local/share/yate/nib_web yatebts_nib


Configuration
-------------

Before using the interface, the permissions for the directories that are 
set in the $yate_conf_dir variable MUST be set.

The command that has to be runned as root (if the default settings are set) is:
chmod -R a+rw /usr/local/etc/yate/ 

Failing to configure the right permissions will make the interface display some errors
the first time when it's used.
